# ðŸ‘‹ Hello.
I'm @fpandyv, and I'm working with **Fountain Products, BT**. We're dedicated to bringing innovative technological solutions to the world of **restaurant equipment and supply.**


## ðŸ‘€ Ideas? We're interested!

We welcome **exciting new ideas** and solutions to help us solve existing industry problems. Since we have to think on our feet, we absolutely love **open source software** solutions. Lately, we've been focused heavily on **monitoring industry trends** and **gathering data** about the issues restaurateurs face when dealing with online supply services.

## ðŸŒ± We are always learning.

Currently, we are learning to utilize **data visualization** tools like [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to help us optimize ordering and other internal business processes. In the future we plan to leverage data analysis tools against the ordering and supply chain challenges.

## ðŸ“« Get in touch.
We're available online at [www.fountain-products.com/contact-us](https://fountain-products.com/contact-us). If you have an inquiry for me in particular, you can reach me at [infotechs@fountain-products.com](mailto:infotechs@fountain-products.com).
